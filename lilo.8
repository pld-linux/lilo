.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
.B lilo
installs a boot loader that will be activated next time you boot.
It has lots of options.
.LP
.TP
.B "\-\^c"
Enable map compaction. This will merge read requests from adjacent
sectors. Speeds up the booting (especially from floppy).
.TP
.BI "\-\^C " config-file
.B lilo
reads its instructions about what files to map from its
config file, by default
.IR "/etc/lilo.conf" .
This option can be used to specify a non-default config file.
.TP
.BI "\-\^d " delay
If you have specified several kernels, and press Shift at boot-time,
the boot loader will present you with a choice of which system
to boot. After a timeout period the first kernel in the list
is booted. This option specifies the timeout delay in deciseconds.
.TP
.BI "\-\^D " label
Use the kernel with the given label, instead of the first one
in the list, as the default kernel to boot.
.TP
.BI "\-\^f " disk-tab
Specify disk geometry parameter file. (The default is
.IR /etc/disktab .)
.TP
.BI "\-\^i " boot-loader
Specify a file to be used as the new boot loader. (The default is
.IR /boot/boot.b .)
.TP
.BI "\-\^I " "label"
The label of the running kernel can be found in the environment
variable BOOT_IMAGE after startup, or in the pseudo-file `/proc/cmdline'.
This command will print the corresponding path name on stdout.
.TP
.BI "\-\^l"
Generate linear sector addresses instead of sector/head/cylinder
addresses.
.TP
.BI "\-\^L"
Generate 32-bit Logical Block Addresses instead of C:H:S addresses, allowing
access to all partitions on disks with more than 1024 cylinders.
.TP
.BI "\-\^m " map-file
Use specified map file instead of the default.
.TP
.BI "\-\^P " "{fix|ignore}"
Fix (or ignore) `corrupt' partition tables, i.e., partition tables
with linear and sector/head/cylinder addresses that do not correspond.
.TP
.B \-\^q
List the currently mapped files.
.B lilo
maintains a file, by default
.IR "/boot/map" ,
containing the name and location of the kernel(s) to boot.
This option will list the names therein.  Use with \fB-v\fP for
more detailed information about the installed boot loader.
.TP
.BI "\-\^r " root-directory
Before doing anything else, do a \fIchroot\fP to the indicated
directory. Used for repairing a setup from a boot floppy.
.TP
.BI "\-\^R " "command line"
This option sets the default command for the boot loader the next
time it executes. The boot loader will then erase this line: this
is a once-only command. It is typically used in reboot scripts,
just before calling `shutdown -r'.
.TP
.BI "\-\^s " save-file
When
.B lilo
overwrites the boot sector, it preserves the old contents in
a file, by default
.I /boot/boot.NNNN
where NNNN depends on the device. This option specifies an
alternate save file for the boot sector. (Or, together with the
\fB-u\fP option, specifies from where to restore the boot sector.)
.TP
.BI "\-\^S " save-file
Normally,
.B lilo
will not overwrite an existing save file. This options says
that overwriting is allowed.
.TP
.BI "\-\^t "
Test only. Do not really write a new boot sector or map file.
Use together with \fB-v\fP to find out what
.B lilo
is about to do.
.TP
.BI "\-\^u " device-name
Uninstall
.BR lilo ,
by copying the saved boot sector back. A time-stamp is checked.
.TP
.BI "\-\^U " device-name
Idem, but do not check the time-stamp.
.TP
.B \-\^v
Increase verbosity. Giving one to five \fB-v\fP options
will make lilo more verbose, or use, \fB-v\fP \fIn\fP (n=1..5) to
set verbosity level '\fIn\fP'.
.TP
.B "\-\^V"
Print version number.

.SH INCOMPATIBILITIES
.B lilo
is known to have problems with the
.I reiserfs
introduced with the 2.4.x kernel, unless the file system is
mounted with the 'notail' option.
