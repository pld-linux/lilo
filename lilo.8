\- install boot loader
.LP
Auxiliary uses:
.LP
.B " /sbin/lilo -q"
\- query map
.br
.B " /sbin/lilo -R"
\- set default command line for next reboot
.br
.B " /sbin/lilo -I"
\- inquire path name of current kernel
.br
.B " /sbin/lilo {-u|-U}"
\- uninstall lilo
.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
.B lilo
installs a boot loader that will be activated next time you boot.
It has lots of options.
.LP
.TP
.B \-\^v
Increase verbosity. Giving one or more \fB-v\fP options
will make lilo more verbose.
.TP
.B \-\^q
List the currently mapped files.
.B lilo
maintains a file, by default
.IR "/boot/map" ,
containing the name and location of the kernel(s) to boot.
This option will list the names therein.
.TP
.BI "\-\^m " map-file
Use specified map file instead of the default.
.TP
.BI "\-\^C " config-file
.B lilo
reads its instructions about what files to map from its
config file, by default
.IR "/etc/lilo.conf" .
This option can be used to specify a non-default config file.
.TP
.BI "\-\^d " delay
If you have specified several kernels, and press Shift at boot-time,
the boot loader will present you with a choice of which system
to boot. After a timeout period the first kernel in the list
is booted. This option specifies the timeout delay in deciseconds.
.TP
.BI "\-\^D " label
Use the kernel with the given label, instead of the first one
in the list, as the default kernel to boot.
.TP
.BI "\-\^r " root-directory
Before doing anything else, do a \fIchroot\fP to the indicated
directory. Used for repairing a setup from a boot floppy.
.TP
.BI "\-\^t "
Test only. Do not really write a new boot sector or map file.
Use together with \fB-v\fP to find out what
.B lilo
is about to do.
.TP
.B "\-\^c"
Enable map compaction. This will merge read requests from adjacent
sectors. Speeds up the booting (especially from floppy).
.TP
.BI "\-\^f " disk-tab
Specify disk geometry parameter file. (The default is
.IR /etc/disktab .)
.TP
.BI "\-\^i " boot-sector
Specify a file to be used as the new boot sector. (The default is
.IR /boot/boot.b .)
.TP
.BI "\-\^l"
Generate linear sector addresses instead of sector/head/cylinder
addresses.
.TP
.BI "\-\^P " "{fix|ignore}"
Fix (or ignore) `corrupt' partition tables, i.e., partition tables
with linear and sector/head/cylinder addresses that do not correspond.
.TP
.BI "\-\^s " save-file
When
.B lilo
overwrites the boot sector, it preserves the old contents in
a file, by default
.I /boot/boot.NNNN
where NNNN depends on the device. This option specifies an
alternate save file for the boot sector. (Or, together with the
\fB-u\fP option, specifies from where to restore the boot sector.)
.TP
.BI "\-\^S " save-file
Normally,
.B lilo
will not overwrite an existing save file. This options says
that overwriting is allowed.
.TP
.BI "\-\^u " device-name
Uninstall
.BR lilo ,
by copying the saved boot sector back. A time-stamp is checked.
.TP
.BI "\-\^U " device-name
Idem, but do not check the time-stamp.
.TP
.BI "\-\^R " "command line"
This option sets the default command for the boot loader the next
time it executes. The boot loader will then erase this line: this
is a once-only command. It is typically used in reboot scripts,
just before calling `shutdown -r'.
.TP
.BI "\-\^I " "label"
The label of the running kernel can be found in the environment
variable BOOT_IMAGE after startup. This command will print the
corresponding path name on stdout.
.TP
.B "\-\^V"
Print version number.

.LP
The above command line options correspond to the key words
in the config file indicated below.
