+.BI "fallback=" <command-line>
+Specified a string that is stored as the default command line if the
+current image is booted. This is useful when experimenting with kernels
+which may crash before allowing interaction with the system. If using the
+\fBfallback\fP option, the next reboot (e.g. triggered by a manual reset
+or by a watchdog timer) will load a different (supposedly stable) kernel.
+The command line by the fallback mechanism is cleared by removing or
+changing the default command line with the '-R' switch.
